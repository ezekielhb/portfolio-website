# Backend Testing & Validation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to test all backend functionality in your portfolio website.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Run the complete `database-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy your project URL and anon key

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update `.env.local` with your actual Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies & Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Schema Issues
```sql
-- If you get column name errors, ensure your database uses snake_case:
-- created_at, updated_at, hero_image, client_name, etc.
```

### Environment Variables
- Ensure `.env.local` exists and has correct format
- Variables must start with `VITE_` for Vite
- No spaces around the equals sign
- Check browser console for environment errors

### RLS (Row Level Security) Issues
- Ensure all RLS policies are created correctly
- Published-only access for public routes
- Full access for authenticated users (or public for now)

### Type Mismatches
- Ensure TypeScript interfaces match database schema
- Check that array fields (tags, skills, etc.) are handled correctly
- Verify JSONB fields (social_links) parse correctly

## Performance Optimization

1. **Database Indexes** - Already created for commonly queried fields
2. **Query Optimization** - Services use specific selects and filters
3. **Caching** - React Query handles caching and invalidation
4. **Image Optimization** - Use properly sized images for better loading

## Security Considerations

1. **RLS Policies** - Implemented for data protection
2. **Input Validation** - Client and server-side validation
3. **Environment Variables** - Sensitive data in environment files
4. **Authentication** - Can be added later for admin protection

## Next Steps

After validating all functionality:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Test production deployment

2. **Add Authentication** (Optional)
   - Implement Supabase Auth for admin routes
   - Add login/logout functionality

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Image upload to Supabase Storage
   - Contact form submissions
   - Analytics integration
   - SEO optimization

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection and RLS policies
3. Ensure all database tables exist
4. Check that environment variables are set correctly
5. Review the BACKEND_SETUP.md for additional guidance

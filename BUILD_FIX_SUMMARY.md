# 🔧 Build Error Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Transform failed with 1 error

**Error Message:** `Expected "{" but found "\"` in TestimonialManagement.tsx:160:21

## 🔨 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Syntax Errors**
- Fixed escaped quotes (`\"`) that should have been regular quotes (`"`)
- Corrected JSX syntax formatting throughout TestimonialManagement.tsx
- Removed malformed string escaping in className attributes

### 2. **Database Schema Alignment**
- ✅ **ProjectService.ts** - Updated to use snake_case database column names
- ✅ **SettingsService.ts** - Fixed column naming consistency
- ✅ **Project types** - Aligned interfaces with database schema
- ✅ **Settings types** - Updated all interfaces to match database
- ✅ **TestimonialManagement.tsx** - Complete rewrite with proper syntax
- ✅ **ProfileSettings.tsx** - Updated field references
- ✅ **ContactSettings.tsx** - Updated field references

### 3. **Component Updates**

## 🎯 Database Schema Mapping

### Before (camelCase) → After (snake_case)
```typescript
// Old (causing errors)
heroImage → hero_image
createdAt → created_at  
updatedAt → updated_at
clientName → client_name
testimonialText → testimonial_text
socialLinks → social_links
profileImage → profile_image

// Fixed in all components and services
```
